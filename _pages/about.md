Hi, I am Prachi _(pronounced: praa-chee)_.

I graduated from Oregon State University (OSU) with a Masters in Computer Science [_(AI track)_](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/artificial-intelligence-and-robotics). I was advised by [Dr. Prasad Tadepalli](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/people/tadepalli-prasad). Prior to OSU, I received B.E. in Computer Science from [Thadomal Shahani Engineering College](https://tsec.edu/) ([University of Mumbai](https://mu.ac.in/)) in Mumbai, India.

My research at OSU was focused on robustness and adversarial attacks on Question Answering models in Natural Language Processing. My primary research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and its applications in various domains. In particular, I am interested in Multilingual language processing and NLP for Computational social sciences.

I also worked part-time as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://careers.mskcc.org/career-areas/data-science-and-engineering/) (MSKCC).

Outside work, I love hiking, playing badminton, cooking vegetarian food, and teaching myself new languages. Check out my blog on food and travel and everything else!
